## Advantages of Bucket4j
* Implemented on top of ideas of well known algorithm, which are by de-facto standard for rate limiting in the IT industry.
* Effective lock-free implementation, Bucket4j is good scalable for multithreading case.
* Absolutely non-compromise precision, Bucket4j does not operate with floats or doubles, all calculation are performed in the integer arithmetic,
this feature protects end users from calculation errors involved by rounding.
* Ability to switch from one JVM to cluster in two lines of code. Using Bucket4j you are able to limiting something in the cluster of JVMs.
Since [release 1.2](https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j/releases/tag/1.2.0) the ```Bucket4j``` supports any GRID solution which compatible with [JCache API (JSR 107)](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107) specification.
Just use your favorite grid including [Hazelcast](http://hazelcast.com/products/hazelcast/), [Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/), [Coherence](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/coherence/overview/index.html), [Infinispan](http://infinispan.org/) or any other.
* Ability to specify more than one bandwidth per bucket. For example you can limit 1000 events per hours but not often then 100 events per minute.

## Get Bucket4j library

#### By direct link
[Download compiled jar, sources, javadocs](https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j/releases/tag/2.2.0)

#### You can build Bucket4j from sources
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j.git
cd bucket4j
mvn clean install
```

#### You can add Bucket4j to your project as maven dependency
The Bucket4j is distributed through both [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) and [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/),
use any of them:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.vladimir-bukhtoyarov</groupId>
    <artifactId>bucket4j-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```
To use JCache extension you also need to add following dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.vladimir-bukhtoyarov</groupId>
    <artifactId>bucket4j-jcache</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
